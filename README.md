### ðŸ˜„  About Me

Welcome to my professional portfolio! I'm a software engineer with over a decade as a QA engineer. Recently, I found myself at a crossroads due to layoffs at Indeed. Instead of seeing it as a setback, I viewed it as an opportunity to refine my technical skills and transition into a development role.

During my time in App Academy's full-stack software engineering track, I immersed myself in building three full-stack applications. Using JavaScript, React, Redux, Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy, I not only expanded my technical toolkit but also cultivated a deep appreciation for clean and efficient software development.

What sets me apart is my foundation in QA. Having spent years ensuring the quality of software, I bring a unique perspective to development. My understanding of testing, deployment, and the importance of quality gives me a holistic view of the software development life cycle.

I'm not just excited about this new chapter in my career; I'm genuinely eager to collaborate with forward-thinking teams. My goal is to contribute to the creation of reliable, high-performing applications. Let's embark on this journey togetherâ€”I'm ready to bring my dual perspective and dedication to quality to your team!

Please feel free to explore my portfolio for more details on my projects. Thanks for visiting!
