I'm a QA Engineer with a focus on ensuring quality across the software development lifecycle, combining manual testing with test automation to drive efficiency. At Indeed, I worked with cross-functional teams to improve test automation coverage to 80%, streamline build processes, and reduce system downtime by 40%. My experience spans optimizing CI/CD pipelines and enhancing test coverage, but I approach testing holistically, ensuring both manual and automated testing meet the highest standards.
